# ChurnPilot - Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

ChurnPilot is an AI-powered credit card churning management system. The architecture prioritizes **modularity** to allow UI framework swaps (Streamlit → React) without touching core business logic.

## Permissions

**Full workspace permissions granted for this project:**

Claude has been granted full autonomy within this workspace to:
- Create, modify, and delete files
- Run git commands (add, commit, push, etc.)
- Execute tests and verification scripts
- Install dependencies via pip
- Run deployment checks
- Make architectural decisions for improvements
- Commit changes with co-authorship attribution

**Scope:** All permissions are limited to this workspace (`C:\Users\JayCh\workspace\churn_copilot\`)

**Safety guardrails:**
- No destructive git operations without explicit approval (force push, hard reset)
- No modifications to production deployment secrets
- All changes committed to git for easy rollback
- Major architectural changes should be documented in plan mode first

**Autonomous improvement guidelines:**
- Focus on high-impact user experience improvements
- Maintain code quality and testing standards
- Document all decisions for user review
- Prefer polish over new features when working without user guidance

## Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns

```
src/
├── core/           # Framework-agnostic business logic
│   ├── extractor.py    # AI extraction (Anthropic API)
│   ├── models.py       # Pydantic data models
│   └── storage.py      # Data persistence layer
└── ui/             # UI layer (currently Streamlit)
    └── app.py
```

- **core/** must have ZERO UI dependencies
- **ui/** imports from core, never the reverse
- All AI logic lives in `core/extractor.py`

## Coding Standards

### Type Hints (Required)

All functions must have complete type annotations:

```python
def extract_card_data(raw_text: str) -> CardData:
    ...

def get_cards_by_issuer(issuer: str) -> list[Card]:
    ...
```

### Docstrings (Google Style)

```python
def parse_annual_fee(text: str) -> int | None:
    """Extract annual fee amount from card terms text.

    Args:
        text: Raw text containing card terms and conditions.

    Returns:
        Annual fee in dollars, or None if not found.

    Raises:
        ExtractionError: If text format is invalid.
    """
```

### Pydantic Models for Data

All structured data uses Pydantic for validation:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import date

class Card(BaseModel):
    name: str
    issuer: str
    annual_fee: int
    signup_bonus: SignupBonus | None
    credits: list[Credit]
```

### Error Handling

- Use custom exceptions in `core/exceptions.py`
- Never let raw API errors bubble to UI
- Log errors with context

### Naming Conventions

- Files: `snake_case.py`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## AI Integration Guidelines

### Anthropic API Usage

- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for extraction tasks
- Always use structured output (JSON mode) for parsing
- Keep prompts in separate constants for maintainability
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff

### Prompt Engineering

- Extraction prompts live in `core/prompts.py`
- Version prompts with comments
- Test prompts against edge cases before deploying

## Testing

- Unit tests in `tests/` mirror `src/` structure
- Mock external APIs in tests
- Minimum coverage: core extraction logic

## Environment

- Python 3.11+
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Secrets via environment variables (never commit)

## Change Verification

**Always verify changes compile/run before completing a task:**

```bash
# 1. Syntax check (catches typos, missing colons, etc.)
python -m py_compile src/core/module.py

# 2. Import check (catches missing dependencies, import errors)
# IMPORTANT: py_compile does NOT catch import errors!
python -c "import src.core.module"

# 3. Run the app to verify full functionality
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

**Verification Levels:**
| Check | Catches | Misses |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `py_compile` | Syntax errors | Missing imports, bad imports |
| `import module` | Import errors, missing deps | Runtime errors |
| Run app | Most issues | Edge cases |

**When adding new dependencies:**
1. Add to `requirements.txt`
2. **Always remind user to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`** - never assume they will do this
3. Verify with import check, not just syntax check

**Rules:**
- Never assume code works - verify it
- `py_compile` is NOT sufficient for files with new imports
- **Always use import checks (`python -c "import module"`) not just syntax checks for files with new imports**
- Test new features manually after implementation

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages: `type: description` (e.g., `feat: add SUB deadline parsing`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`

---

## Development Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow

**Standard flow for implementing new features:**

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Clarify user needs and expected behavior
   - Identify deployment context (web/desktop, mobile users)
   - Document in plan mode for complex features

2. **Implementation**
   - Start with core logic (framework-agnostic)
   - Add UI layer last
   - Commit incrementally with descriptive messages

3. **Verification** (see detailed sections below)
   - Syntax/import checks
   - **User-facing testing** (critical - see below)
   - Deployment context validation

4. **Documentation**
   - Update docstrings
   - Add to execution logs if significant
   - Update README if user-facing

### User-Facing Testing Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always test like a real user, not just verify code compiles.**

This workflow prevents bugs that only appear in real usage:

```bash
# 1. Start the application
streamlit run src/ui/app.py

# 2. Open in browser (Streamlit auto-opens, or navigate to http://localhost:8501)

# 3. Test critical user journeys:
```

**Critical User Journeys to Test:**

1. **Adding Cards**
   - ✓ Add card from URL (paste URL, click extract)
   - ✓ Add card from library (select template, enter details)
   - ✓ Verify card appears in dashboard
   - ✓ Check tab doesn't unexpectedly switch

2. **Viewing Cards**
   - ✓ Dashboard loads with all cards
   - ✓ Cards display correct information
   - ✓ Filtering works (by issuer, search)
   - ✓ Sorting works (by date, fee, etc.)

3. **Editing Cards**
   - ✓ Click edit on a card
   - ✓ Modify fields
   - ✓ Save changes
   - ✓ Verify updates appear

4. **Benefits Tracking**
   - ✓ Mark credit as used this period
   - ✓ Verify checkmark appears
   - ✓ Snooze reminders
   - ✓ Check Action Required tab updates

5. **Data Persistence** (CRITICAL)
   - ✓ Add/modify data
   - ✓ **Close browser completely**
   - ✓ **Reopen browser and navigate to app**
   - ✓ **Verify data is still there**

6. **Import/Export**
   - ✓ Export data (download JSON)
   - ✓ Clear all data
   - ✓ Import from JSON
   - ✓ Verify all cards restored correctly

7. **Edge Cases**
   - ✓ Test with empty state (no cards)
   - ✓ Test with many cards (20+)
   - ✓ Test with missing optional fields
   - ✓ Test invalid inputs

**Why This Matters:**

Example bugs caught ONLY by user-facing testing:
- `st.rerun()` causing tab switches (syntax check passed ✓, but UX broken ✗)
- Data not persisting after browser restart (code compiled ✓, but storage broken ✗)
- File storage on server won't work for mobile users (logic correct ✓, deployment context wrong ✗)

### Bug Fix Workflow

**When user reports a bug:**

1. **Reproduce**
   - Follow exact steps user described
   - Verify bug exists in current code
   - Document reproduction steps

2. **Diagnose Root Cause**
   - Read relevant code sections
   - Check execution logs
   - Consider deployment context
   - Don't assume - investigate

3. **Fix with Minimal Changes**
   - Target the root cause
   - Avoid scope creep
   - Don't refactor unrelated code
   - Keep changes focused

4. **Test the Fix**
   - Verify bug no longer reproduces
   - **User-facing testing** (see above)
   - Check for regressions

5. **Document**
   - Clear commit message explaining what was wrong
   - Update execution logs if significant
   - Add comment if fix is non-obvious

### Iterative Improvement Workflow

**Continuous improvement based on feedback:**

1. **Gather Feedback**
   - User pain points
   - Credit card forum discussions
   - Your own observations during testing

2. **Prioritize**
   - Critical bugs first
   - High-impact UX improvements
   - Nice-to-haves last

3. **Small Iterations**
   - One improvement at a time
   - Test after each change
   - Commit incrementally

4. **Validate**
   - Get user confirmation
   - Test with real workflows
   - Measure impact

5. **Repeat**
   - Build on learnings
   - Refine approach
   - Keep improving

## Deployment Context Considerations

**Critical: Storage approach depends on deployment context**

### Web Deployment (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, etc.)

**Context:**
- Multiple users accessing same app instance
- Server filesystem is ephemeral (resets on redeployment)
- Mobile users can't access server file paths
- Each user needs isolated data

**Storage Requirements:**
- ✓ Browser localStorage (client-side)
- ✗ Server file storage (ephemeral, shared)
- ✗ File paths like `~/.churnpilot/cards.json` (server-side only)

**Implementation:**
- Use `WebStorage` class (browser localStorage only)
- Data stored in user's browser
- Survives redeployments
- Works on mobile, desktop, tablet
- Each user has private data

**Key Files:**
- `src/core/web_storage.py` - Browser-only storage
- Uses `streamlit-js-eval` for localStorage access
- Requires `pyarrow` dependency

### Desktop Deployment (localhost, single user)

**Context:**
- One user running locally
- Persistent file system
- Can use file-based storage

**Storage Options:**
- ✓ File storage (e.g., `~/.churnpilot/cards.json`)
- ✓ SQLite database
- ✓ Can also use localStorage for web-like experience

**Implementation:**
- Use `CardStorage` class (file-based)
- Data persists across restarts
- Easy to backup/migrate
- Can edit manually

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Wrong: Using file storage for web deployment**
```python
# This won't work for mobile users or survive redeployments:
STORAGE_PATH = Path.home() / '.churnpilot' / 'cards.json'
```

**✓ Right: Use browser localStorage for web deployment**
```python
# Data stored in user's browser, works everywhere:
localStorage.setItem('churnpilot_cards', JSON.stringify(data))
```

**❌ Wrong: Assuming server paths work for all users**
```python
# Mobile users can't access server filesystem:
with open('~/.churnpilot/cards.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

**✓ Right: Consider deployment context**
```python
# Check if we're in web or desktop context:
if is_web_deployment():
    storage = WebStorage()  # Browser localStorage
else:
    storage = CardStorage()  # File-based
```

## Streamlit-Specific Gotchas

**Important considerations when using Streamlit:**

### 1. st.rerun() Resets Tabs

**Problem:**
- `st.rerun()` reruns entire app from top
- Streamlit tabs default to first tab
- No programmatic tab selection available

**Impact:**
- User adds card in "Add Card" tab → `st.rerun()` → switches to "Dashboard" tab
- Confusing UX - user has to navigate back

**Solutions:**
```python
# ❌ Bad: Forces tab switch
st.success("Card added!")
st.rerun()

# ✓ Good: Let user navigate manually
st.success("✓ Card added!")
st.info("Switch to Dashboard tab to see your card")
# No rerun - card will appear when user switches tabs
```

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Use query parameters to maintain tab state
- Use sidebar navigation instead of tabs
- Minimize `st.rerun()` usage

### 2. Session State vs Persistent Storage

**Streamlit session state:**
- In-memory only
- Lost on browser refresh
- Separate per tab/window
- Fast access

**Persistent storage (localStorage/files):**
- Survives browser restarts
- Shared across tabs (localStorage)
- Slower access
- Requires serialization

**Best Practice:**
```python
# Use session state as cache
if "cards_data" not in st.session_state:
    # Load from persistent storage once
    st.session_state.cards_data = load_from_storage()

# Work with session state
cards = st.session_state.cards_data

# Save to persistent storage when changed
save_to_storage(cards)
```

### 3. JavaScript Evaluation Timing

**Issue:** `streamlit-js-eval` can have timing issues

```python
# ❌ Problematic: May return None due to timing
result = streamlit_js_eval(js="localStorage.getItem('key')")

# ✓ Better: Use Promise with timeout
js_code = """
(function() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(localStorage.getItem('key'));
        }, 100);
    });
})()
"""
result = streamlit_js_eval(js=js_code, key=f"unique_key_{time.time()}")
```

**Requirements:**
- Requires `pyarrow` to be installed
- Need unique `key` parameter for each call to avoid caching
- Handle None/null returns gracefully

### 4. Widget State Persistence

**Problem:** Widget values don't persist across reruns unless using `key` parameter

```python
# ❌ Bad: Value lost on rerun
card_name = st.text_input("Card Name")

# ✓ Good: Value persists in session state
card_name = st.text_input("Card Name", key="card_name_input")
# Access later: st.session_state.card_name_input
```

## Testing Strategy

### Levels of Testing

| Level | What It Tests | When to Use |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Individual functions, pure logic | Core business logic, utilities |
| **Integration Tests** | Module interactions | Storage + models, extractor + API |
| **Syntax Checks** | Code compiles | After every change |
| **Import Checks** | Dependencies available | After adding imports/deps |
| **User-Facing Tests** | Real user workflows | **Always before saying "done"** |

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing any feature or fix:

- [ ] **Syntax check passes:** `python -m py_compile <files>`
- [ ] **Import check passes:** `python -c "import module"`
- [ ] **App starts:** `streamlit run src/ui/app.py`
- [ ] **Critical user journeys work** (add card, view, edit, persist)
- [ ] **No console errors** (check browser console, terminal output)
- [ ] **Deployment context considered** (web vs desktop)
- [ ] **Commit message is descriptive**

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before sharing with pilot users:

- [ ] **All pre-commit checks pass**
- [ ] **Test data persistence** (close browser, reopen, verify)
- [ ] **Test on target platform** (Streamlit Cloud, not just localhost)
- [ ] **Test on mobile device** (if web deployment)
- [ ] **Test in incognito mode** (privacy settings)
- [ ] **Export/import works**
- [ ] **Dependencies documented** (`requirements.txt` up to date)
- [ ] **User-facing documentation updated** (if needed)

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Only Testing Code Compilation

**Symptom:** Code compiles and imports work, but app breaks in real usage

**Example:**
```python
# This compiles fine:
st.success("Card added")
st.rerun()

# But causes tab switching bug in real usage
```

**Solution:** Always do user-facing testing (see workflow above)

### Pitfall 2: Wrong Deployment Context

**Symptom:** Works on localhost, breaks in production

**Example:**
- File storage at `~/.churnpilot/cards.json` works locally
- Breaks on Streamlit Cloud (ephemeral filesystem)
- Mobile users can't access it

**Solution:** Design for target deployment from the start

### Pitfall 3: Assuming Browser APIs Just Work

**Symptom:** localStorage code looks correct but data doesn't persist

**Potential Causes:**
- Missing `pyarrow` dependency
- Browser privacy settings blocking localStorage
- JavaScript timing issues with `streamlit-js-eval`
- Incognito mode restrictions
- Insufficient localStorage quota

**Solution:**
- Create diagnostic tools (like `diagnose_storage.py`)
- Test in multiple browsers
- Check browser console for errors
- Handle failures gracefully

### Pitfall 4: Over-Engineering Solutions

**Symptom:** Complex implementation when simple solution exists

**Example:**
- Created HybridStorage (localStorage + file fallback)
- File fallback doesn't help web users
- Simple WebStorage (localStorage only) was sufficient

**Solution:**
- Start with simplest approach that meets requirements
- Add complexity only when proven necessary
- Question assumptions (ask "why do we need this?")

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights from Development

1. **User-facing testing is not optional**
   - Compilation ≠ working software
   - Always test like a real user
   - Close and reopen to test persistence

2. **Deployment context matters immensely**
   - What works locally may not work in production
   - Mobile users have different constraints
   - Server storage ≠ client storage

3. **Simple is better**
   - Don't add "just in case" features
   - Solve the actual problem, not hypothetical ones
   - Easier to add complexity than remove it

4. **Framework quirks require attention**
   - Streamlit's `st.rerun()` resets state
   - Session state vs persistent storage
   - JavaScript eval timing issues

5. **Real user feedback is invaluable**
   - Users catch what developers miss
   - Test with real workflows
   - Listen to pain points
